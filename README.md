## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I fiddled around quite a bit until I figured out how to build a grid to control the card positions and adapt it to different devices according to the specifications. Thus, I learned a lot about grid usage.

### Continued development

I'm wondering if there isn't an alternative way to implement the cross-stack layout.
